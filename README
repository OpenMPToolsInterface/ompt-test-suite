1. Building the test suite with GCC

To build the tests, make sure that your built GCC 4.8.2 is in your path(s):

export GCC_HOME=$HOME/install/gcc-4.8.2
export PATH=$GCC_HOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$GCC_HOME/lib64:$GCC_HOME/lib

# and if necessary...

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/install/mpc-1.0.1/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/install/mpfr-3.1.1/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/install/gmp-5.1.0/lib

...then just "make -f Makefile.gcc" and run the tests.


2. Building the test suite with Intel compiler

Define INTEL_OMP_ROOT environment variable to point to the location of Intel OpenMP library (not necessarily the location of Intel compiler).
Then type
  make -f Makefile.intel
to build
