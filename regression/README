OMPT defines an application programming interface through which one can write 
powerful monitoring or analysis software for OpenMP applications. However, 
traditionally various vendors usually have diâ†µerent OpenMP runtime, and as
 of now, there is not an easy way to automatically determine whether a 
particular OpenMP fully supports the OMPT standard. This motivates us 
to develop an automatic test suite for that purpose. Our test suite is 
fully automatic. After running it, you will be able to tell whether the 
runtime you are testing against is a minimally-compliant implementation 
of the OMPT specification.


To build the test for intel platform, type:
make comp=intel
