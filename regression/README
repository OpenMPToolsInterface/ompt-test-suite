OMPT defines an application programming interface through which
one can write powerful monitoring or analysis software for OpenMP
applications. However, traditionally various vendors usually have
diâ†µerent OpenMP runtime, and as
 of now, there is not an easy way to automatically determine whether a
particular OpenMP fully supports the OMPT standard. This motivates us
to develop an automatic test suite for that purpose. Our test suite is
fully automatic. After running it, you will be able to tell whether the
runtime you are testing against is a minimally-compliant implementation
of the OMPT specification.

Currently, the Makefile provides support for xlc, icc, and gcc. xlc
support is geared to work with IBM's OMPT-enhanced LOMP runtime. icc and
gcc support are geared to work with an OMPT-enhanced version of Intel's
open source runtime, which is available at

	git clone https://code.google.com/p/ompt-intel-openmp/

To build the regression tests for the Intel runtime

	cd regression
	export INTEL_COMPILER_ROOT=/pathto/your/intel/ompt-intel-openmp 
	make -j compiler=xxx (where xxx = icc or gcc)

To build the regression tests for the IBM LOMP runtime, 

	cd regression
	export IBM_COMPILER_ROOT=/pathto/your/ibm/compiler/root  
	make -j compiler=xlc
